# ALPU-License

## Official Repository for the ALPU Licensing Standard

The **ALPU-License** is an original software license designed for personal and commercial usage of software projects while maintaining control over modifications and derivatives. The following repo serves as the source for the ALPU license(s) family, including the standard **ALPU-License**, **ALEPU-Extensive-License**, & **ALLPU-Loosely-License**. It provides the official license texts, version history, specification, and reference materials governing how the ALPU license family is applied and interpreted.

## License Varients

The ALPU family (Asuka License for Protective Use) is a set of software licenses designed for creators who require strong control over modifications and derivative works while still allowing unrestricted use and redistribution of the original, unmodified software.

These licenses are intended for projects that benefit from open availability of source code but must prevent unauthorized forks, modifications, closed-source derivatives, or competitive re-releases.

The ALPU family includes three primary variants:

1. **ALPU v1.2** (Standard Protective License)  
   Designed for strong protective use. Prevents modification, derivative
   works, and relicensing without explicit written permission from the
   Licensor. Redistribution of unmodified copies is allowed.

2. **ALEPU v1.0** (Extensive Protective License)  
   An enhanced restrictive variant of ALPU. Includes all ALPU protections with additional prohibitions on linking, embedding, extraction, code-integration, and transformative analysis beyond reading. Intended for high-security or sensitive software.

3. **ALLPU v1.0** (Loosely Protective License)  
   A lighter, open-source-compatible version. Allows modification and redistribution as long as the resulting work remains open-source, licensed under ALLPU, and fully preserves attribution. Closed-source derivatives require explicit authorization.

## Governing Law

All licenses in the ALPU family are governed by and interpreted under the laws of **California, United States**, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. This applies to every recipient, regardless of their jurisdiction.

## Copyright

Each ALPU-family license must include the following identifiers:

- Copyright notice: Copyright 2025 © Asuka Org

- The exact version of the license used: ALPU v1.2, ALEPU v1.0, or ALLPU v1.0

## License Comparisons

Compared to permissive licenses (**MIT, BSD, Apache**): ALPU is significantly more restrictive, as it forbids modification and derivative creation without permission.  

Compared to strong copyleft licenses (**GPL, AGPL**): ALPU is not copyleft, but it also does not permit modification. It protects authorship rather than ensuring community freedom.  

Compared to proprietary **EULAs**: ALPU is less restrictive regarding usage, but more restrictive regarding alteration and redistributions of altered copies.  

Compared to Creative Commons licenses: ALPU maps most closely to CC BY-ND (No Derivatives), but with a stronger enforcement model and explicit software-oriented terms.
